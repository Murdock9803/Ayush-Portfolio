# Ayush-Portfolio
This repository serves as the home of my portfolio site. I am a Developer and Open Source Contributor from India (Also a serious Matt Murdock/Daredevil fan).

I have worked with Creative Commons at [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/ZIhUmKRN). After that, I worked with teams at the [Government of Karnataka (Indian state)](https://github.com/Murdock9803/bfbf-technical/blob/main/README.md#build-for-bharat-fellowship--rural-development-and-panchayat-raj-department-government-of-karnataka) on tech solutions for a very large user base. These were great learning experiences, the best I could ask for.
In between and often, I have worked with teams/startups on projects based in Australia, India, etc.
My tech-stack is primarily JavaScript-based, and I am currently interested to learn deeply about Development, Web3, AI, Cinema, Boxing.
