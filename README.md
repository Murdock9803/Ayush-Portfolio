# Ayush-Portfolio
This repository serves as the home of my portfolio site. I am a Developer and Open Source Contributor from India (Also a serious Matt Murdock/Daredevil fan).

I have worked with Creative Commons at Google Summer ofo Code 2024. It was a great learning experience, the best I could ask for.
My tech-stack is primarily JavaScript based, and I am currently learning about bitcoin development and Web3.
